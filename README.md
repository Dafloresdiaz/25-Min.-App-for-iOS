# 25 min. :alarm_clock:
* Create a minimalist Pomodoro technique app

## Objective
* The user can use it to improve their productive time for a certain task, work 25 minutes and rest 5 minutes when the user complete 4 round of work the next rest will be for 20 minutes

### How it works
* Choose you a task you want to work/do
* Start the timer (25 minutes)
  * Right now the user cannot change the work time(25 minutes). The next version will have this functionality :neckbeard:
* When the "work time" is done, the user can rest 5 minutes
* The user will have 4 rounds of "work time" 
* When the user finished the 4 round the rest time will change to 20 minutes
